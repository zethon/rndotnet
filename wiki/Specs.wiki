#summary Specification and Road map for the *Rubik's Cube Notation* programming language*.

== Version 0.1 ==

The prototype will implement the eight commands of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck Brainfuck] programming language mapped to the following notation

|| *U* || *<* || increment the data pointer to the next cell to the right ||
|| *U'* || *>* || decrement the data pointer to the next cell to the right ||
|| *R* || *>* || increment the byte at the data pointer ||
|| *R'* || *>* || decrement the byte at the data pointer ||
|| *F* || *.* || output the byte at the data pointer || 
|| *F'* || *,* || accept one byte of input into the current data pointer ||
|| *(* || *[* || if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command || 
|| *)* || *]* || if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command ||


=== Notes ===

  * Numbers can be added to the U, R, F commands. When appending numbers to a command with a prime symbol ( *'* ), the order of the prime symbol is irrelevant. For example *R2'* is the same as *R'2*. The number appended is one byte in size.
  * Multiple prime symbols will toggle the _prime status_ of the command. For example *R2* is the same as *R2''*.
